# Installation guide — for first-time users

This guide is written for someone who has **never written code, never used GitHub, never opened a terminal**. Every step is spelled out. Take your time — total install is around 20–30 minutes, mostly spent waiting for downloads.

If anything looks weird or you get stuck, take a screenshot and send it to the developer. Don't guess — most steps are reversible, but a wrong API key in the wrong field is annoying to debug.

> **Quick mental model.** This is an app that runs **on your own computer**, not on the internet. You start it like Photoshop or Chrome — there's an icon you double-click, a window opens, you use it, you close it. The "website" you'll see at `http://localhost:3010` is served from your own machine. Nothing leaves your laptop unless you explicitly send it to an external API (like Claude).

---

## Part 1 — Install the prerequisites

You need **one** program installed before the app will run: Node.js. That's it.

### 1.1 Install Node.js (Windows and macOS)

1. Open [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) in your browser.
2. Click the big green **LTS** button. (LTS = "long-term support" = the stable version, which is what you want.)
3. The download starts automatically. You'll get a `.msi` file on Windows or a `.pkg` file on macOS.
4. Double-click the downloaded file and click **Next / Continue / Install** through every screen. Defaults are fine — don't change anything.
5. When it says "Installation complete", close the installer.

**Verify it worked** (optional but recommended):

- **Windows**: press the **Windows key**, type `cmd`, hit Enter. A black window opens. Type `node -v` and press Enter. You should see something like `v20.18.0`. If yes — done. If you get "command not found", reboot your computer and try again.

> **Take the LTS version, not the newest one.** The app's database engine ships ready-made builds for Node 20 through 25. On Node 26 or newer it has to be compiled on your machine instead, which is a common cause of a failed install. The green LTS button gives you the right one.
- **macOS**: open **Terminal** (press ⌘+Space, type `Terminal`, hit Enter). Type `node -v` and press Enter. Same expected output.

### 1.2 (Windows only) Install "Visual Studio Build Tools" — recommended before you install

The app's database engine is not plain code — it's partly written in a lower-level language (C++) and needs to be "compiled" (translated into a form your computer can run) the first time you install. Windows doesn't come with the tool that does this translation, so it's worth installing it up front to avoid a failed install later.

1. Open [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and download the installer.
2. Run it. When the list of "workloads" appears, check **Desktop development with C++**.
3. Click **Install**. This can take 10–15 minutes and several GB of disk space — that's normal.
4. Once it finishes, you can continue to Part 2.

If you'd rather skip this for now: it's fine, just come back here if `install.bat` later fails and mentions the database engine or a compiler.

### 1.3 Python — you do not need it

You may have read older instructions telling you to install Python. You don't, and it doesn't matter whether you use the installer or type `npm install` yourself.

Older versions pulled in a component that refused to install without Python, and then downloaded its engine through a GitHub address that many networks block. Both ran during installation, so a problem with an optional feature — reading video transcripts — could stop the whole app from installing. That component is gone. The transcript engine now downloads by itself the first time you actually ask for a transcript, and if your network blocks it, everything else in the app still works.

---

## Part 2 — Get the project files onto your computer

The project lives on GitHub at:

**https://github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP**

You have two ways to download it. Pick **one**. If you don't know which, pick Option A — it's the simplest and works exactly the same.

### Option A — Download the ZIP from GitHub (simplest)

No account, no extra tools. Best if you just want to run the app.

1. Open **[https://github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP](https://github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP)** in your browser.
2. Find the green **`<> Code`** button (near the top, above the file list) → click it.
3. In the dropdown, click **Download ZIP** (at the bottom).
4. The ZIP downloads to your **Downloads** folder. It will be named `YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP-main.zip`.
5. Extract it:
   - **Windows**: right-click the ZIP → **Extract All...** → **Extract**.
   - **macOS**: double-click the ZIP.
6. You now have a folder called `YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP-main` containing `package.json`, `README.md`, `install.bat`, `start.bat`, etc.

### Option B — Clone via GitHub Desktop (recommended if you'll get updates)

If the developer is going to push fixes and you want one-click updates without re-downloading the ZIP each time, use GitHub Desktop.

1. Download GitHub Desktop from **[https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)** → install (defaults are fine).
2. Open GitHub Desktop. You can sign in with a GitHub account or skip — both work since the repo is public.
3. **File → Clone repository...** → tab **URL** at the top → paste:
   ```
   https://github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP
   ```
4. **Local path** → **change this away from the default.** Pick something like `C:\Projects` (Windows) or your home folder (Mac) → **Clone**.

   > ⚠️ **Do not clone into OneDrive.** GitHub Desktop suggests `Documents/GitHub/...`, and on most Windows machines `Documents` is synced to OneDrive. OneDrive keeps touching the files while the installer is writing them, which makes the install fail with `EPERM` errors and breaks the app in confusing ways later. The same goes for iCloud Drive, Dropbox and Google Drive.
5. Done. To update later: open GitHub Desktop → click **Fetch origin** → if there are new changes, click **Pull origin**.

### 2.x — Move the folder somewhere safe

This applies to **both options**.

**Don't leave the project in `Downloads`** — browsers and OS cleanup utilities auto-delete old Downloads, which would wipe the app *and your local data* (API keys, transcripts, chat history) along with it. **Don't leave it in a synced cloud folder either** — OneDrive, iCloud Drive, Dropbox or Google Drive. Syncing fights with the installer and corrupts `node_modules`. On Windows, `Documents` is very often OneDrive without you ever choosing that, so check the real path: if it contains `OneDrive`, move the folder to something like `C:\Projects` and run the installer again from there.

Move (drag-and-drop is fine) the folder to:

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP`
- **macOS**: `~/Documents/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP` (under `Macintosh HD/Users/<your name>/Documents/`)

> ⚠️ **Don't put the project inside a cloud-sync folder.** OneDrive, iCloud Drive, Dropbox, and Google Drive all silently sync changes to the cloud as you work. The app's SQLite database is touched constantly while the app runs, and these sync services can corrupt the database's WAL files. Keep the project under plain `Documents` (outside any synced subfolder), on your **Desktop**, or in a folder like `C:\dev\` (Windows) / `~/code/` (macOS). Anywhere NOT inside iCloud / OneDrive / Dropbox.

---

## Part 3 — First-time setup (one-time only)

You should now have a folder like `Documents/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP` containing files like `package.json`, `README.md`, `install.bat`, `start.bat`, etc.

### 3.1 Run the installer

This downloads everything the app needs (~300 MB of code libraries). It takes **2–5 minutes** depending on your internet speed.

- **Windows**: double-click `install.bat` in the project folder. A black terminal window opens. It will sit there looking frozen for several minutes — that's normal, the details are being written to `install-log.txt` instead of to the screen. **Wait until it says "Installation complete!"** and asks you to press a key. **Don't close the window early** — interrupting npm mid-install leaves a half-broken `node_modules` folder.
- **macOS**: double-click `install.command`. If macOS shows a popup "cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer":
  - Right-click `install.command` → **Open**.
  - In the popup, click **Open**.
  - macOS remembers your choice; next time it'll just open.

> **If install fails**: the installer now reads its own log and prints the likely cause on screen before it stops — read that box first, it is usually the whole answer. Every run also writes `install-log.txt` in the project folder; sending us that one file is the fastest way to get help, no screenshots needed.
>
> - **anything about `better-sqlite3`, `node-gyp`, MSB or a compiler** → this is the database engine, and **Python will not fix it**. On Windows install "Visual Studio Build Tools" with the "Desktop development with C++" workload (step 1.2); on macOS run `xcode-select --install`. Then delete `node_modules` and run the installer again.
> - **"youtube-dl-exec needs Python"** or a timeout on `api.github.com` → you are on an old version. Download the current one; that component was removed precisely because it broke installs.
>
> Other causes, in order of how often we see them:
> - **"EPERM"** → a cloud sync service (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive) is holding the files. Move the project somewhere local and reinstall.
> - **Node.js newer than 25** → the database engine has no ready-made build for it and tries to compile. Install the LTS version from step 1.1 instead.
> - **Delete the `node_modules` folder** if it exists, then re-run `install.bat` / `install.command`.
> - "Node.js not found" → go back to step 1.1.
> - "EACCES permission denied" (macOS) → run `sudo chmod +x install.command start.command` in Terminal, from the project folder, then double-click again.

### 3.2 Test that it starts

- **Windows**: double-click `start.bat`.
- **macOS**: double-click `start.command`.

A terminal window opens. After ~5–10 seconds you'll see lines like:

```
▲ Next.js 16.2.4
- Local:        http://localhost:3010
✓ Ready in 2.1s
```

Your default browser should automatically open `http://localhost:3010`. If it doesn't, open your browser yourself and type `http://localhost:3010` in the address bar.

You should see the app's dashboard. It'll be empty (no channels yet) — that's expected.

**To stop the app**: just close the terminal window. (Closing the browser tab does nothing — the server keeps running in the background until you close the terminal.)

---

## Part 4 — Add API keys (Integrations page)

The app needs API keys for the external services it talks to. Every key is stored **locally in `~/.youtube-channel-ai-vip/app.db`** — in your home folder, never uploaded anywhere. You enter each one once and forget about it.

Open the running app (`http://localhost:3010`) and click **Integrations** in the left sidebar.

### 4.1 Claude (Anthropic) — REQUIRED

Without this, the AI chat, hook analyzer, and competitor analysis are all disabled.

1. Go to [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/) → sign in or create an account (any personal email works).
2. Add a payment method: **Billing → Plans → Add credit card**. New accounts often get $5 of free credit.
3. **API Keys → Create Key** → name it `youtube-channel-ai-vip` → **Create Key** → **copy the key** (starts with `sk-ant-...`). You only see it once — copy now.
4. In the app: **Integrations** → paste into **Claude (Anthropic)** → **Save**. The status chip should flip to green "Connected".

> Typical spend: $1–10 / month for light use. Heavy chat use with the Opus advisor can hit $30+ — the **Claude usage** widget on the Integrations page shows live spend so you can watch it.

### 4.2 Deepgram — STRONGLY RECOMMENDED

This is what generates transcripts for videos that don't have YouTube captions. The app runs `yt-dlp` locally to pull audio, streams it to Deepgram, and saves the text. Without Deepgram, you only get YouTube's free `[CC]` captions (≈80% of videos have them).

1. Go to [https://console.deepgram.com/](https://console.deepgram.com/) → sign up. **You get $200 of free credit** — enough for ~770 hours of audio.
2. **API Keys → Create a New API Key** → name it `youtube-channel-ai-vip` → permissions: **Member** → **Create Key** → **copy the key**.
3. In the app: **Integrations** → paste into **Deepgram (speech-to-text)** → **Save**.

> Cost after free credit: $0.0043/min ($0.26/hour). The **Deepgram usage** widget tracks spend.

### 4.3 YouTube Data API key — REQUIRED to add channels

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Top of page → **Select a project** → **New Project** → name it `youtube-channel-ai-vip` → **Create**.
3. Wait ~10 seconds for the project to be created. Make sure you're inside it (top of page should show its name).
4. Left menu → **APIs & Services → Library** → search for **YouTube Data API v3** → click it → **Enable**.
5. Left menu → **APIs & Services → Credentials** → **+ Create Credentials** → **API key**. Copy the key (starts with `AIza...`).
6. Click the key in the list → **API restrictions** → **Restrict key** → check only **YouTube Data API v3** → **Save**. (Security best practice — the key now only works for YouTube.)
7. In the app: **Integrations** → paste into **YouTube Data API v3** → **Save**.

> Free quota: 10,000 units/day. Plenty for syncing many channels with regular updates.

### 4.4 Google OAuth (for Analytics + revenue data) — OPTIONAL but unlocks the best features

This is what lets the app pull real Analytics data (views over time, retention, revenue, traffic sources) directly from YouTube on your behalf.

1. In the same Google Cloud project as step 4.3, enable **two** more APIs the same way (**APIs & Services → Library** → search the name → **Enable**):
   - **YouTube Analytics API** — views over time, retention, traffic sources, revenue.
   - **YouTube Reporting API** — thumbnail **impressions and click-through rate**. This is a separate service from the two above and is **off by default**; if you skip it, everything else still works, but the thumbnail tools fall back to ranking your covers by views instead of by clicks.

   > **Why CTR needs its own API.** Click-through is private owner-only data, so no API key can reach it — only a connected Google account. It also arrives differently: Google prepares a file once a day rather than answering a question on the spot. Two consequences worth knowing up front:
   >
   > - The **first file can take up to 48 hours** after you enable this. Nothing is broken in the meantime.
   > - Google only backfills **30 days before the day you enable it**, so enabling it early is worth doing even if you don't need CTR yet — the history you skip cannot be recovered later.
   >
   > Once files start arriving, the app collects them whenever you open it. Your computer does **not** need to be running when a file is generated: Google keeps each one for 60 days.
2. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**:
   - **User Type**: External → **Create**.
   - **App name**: `YouTube Channel AI VIP`. **User support email**: your email. **Developer contact email**: your email. **Save and continue**.
   - **Branding** (Google Auth Platform → Branding). Google will not let you publish until these are filled in — the **Publish app** button shows a grey tooltip about "homepage url and privacy policy url" otherwise. Fill in:
     - **Application home page**: `https://github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP`
     - **Application privacy policy link**: `https://github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP/blob/main/PRIVACY.md`
     - **Authorized domains** → **Add domain** → `github.com`
     - **Save**. (No logo needed, and nothing here needs Google to verify anything.)
   - **Scopes** → **Add or remove scopes** → add all three:
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics-monetary.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`
   - **Save and continue**.
   - **Audience** → click **Publish app** so the publishing status reads **In production**. Confirm the dialog. **You can skip the Test users list entirely** — it only applies to apps left in **Testing**, and Testing is exactly what makes Google drop your connection every 7 days.

   > ⚠️ **If your channel sits on a Brand Account**, the account you sign in with must be the **personal Google account that owns the Brand Account** — a Brand Account has no login of its own. When you connect it in the app, Google shows a channel picker and you choose the brand channel there.
   >
   > **Editor or Manager access is not enough.** Google's own rule: *"invited users can't access: YouTube Music, YouTube Kids app, YouTube APIs"* ([source](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9481328)). Anyone invited through YouTube channel permissions — any role — is blocked from the API no matter what they can see in Studio. It has to be the owner. You can check who that is in **YouTube Studio → Settings → Permissions**.
3. **APIs & Services → Credentials → + Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**:
   - **Application type**: Web application.
   - **Name**: `youtube-channel-ai-vip`.
   - **Authorized redirect URIs** → **Add URI** → paste **exactly**:
     ```
     http://localhost:3010/api/youtube/oauth/callback
     ```
     No trailing slash. Must be `http://` (not `https://`) because this is local. If you run the app on a different port via `port.txt`, use that port here instead — the Integrations page inside the app shows the exact line for your setup.
   - **Create**.
   - The popup shows **Client ID** and **Client secret** → copy both.
4. In the app: **Integrations** → scroll to **YouTube Analytics (Google OAuth)** → paste **Client ID** and **Client secret** → **Save**.
5. Then for each channel you've added, click the **Google** button next to it → sign in with the channel's owner account → grant all 3 permissions → page redirects back to the app.

   > Google will show an **"app isn't verified"** screen on the way. That is expected and safe — this is your own app reading your own data, and Google only removes that screen for apps that pass a public review. Click **Advanced → Go to (your app name)**. You do not need verification: Google exempts apps used only by you, or by a few people you know personally.

> Token expiry: the 7-day re-login only happens while your OAuth app's publishing status is **Testing**. Publishing it (step 2, **Audience → Publish app**) removes that clock for good. One catch: the expiry is baked into a token the moment it is issued — so publish **first**, then click **Reconnect** once, otherwise the token you already hold still dies on schedule.

### 4.5 Apify — OPTIONAL (fallback transcription + competitor scraping)

Apify is useful if Deepgram + yt-dlp fails for some reason, and for scraping competitor channels. Free plan ships $5/month of credit.

1. Sign up at [apify.com](https://apify.com).
2. Console → your profile → **Settings → Integrations** → copy your **Personal API token** (starts with `apify_api_`).
3. In the app: **Integrations** → paste into **Apify** → **Save**.

### 4.6 Exa & Gemini — OPTIONAL

Same pattern. Self-explanatory help text is on each card in the Integrations page (click "How to get an X API key" to expand the steps).

### 4.7 Image generation — OPTIONAL, needed only for generated thumbnails

Only required if you want the app to **generate thumbnails** for you (Ideation → Thumbnails). Everything else works without it.

Scroll to the **Image generation** section at the bottom of the Integrations page and click **Add**. Pick one provider, paste its key, click **Save**:

| Provider | Where to get a key | Roughly per image |
|---|---|---|
| kie.ai | [kie.ai/api-key](https://kie.ai/api-key) | free credits on signup, then ~$0.02 |
| Google Gemini | [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) | $0.13 (Pro) / $0.07 (Flash) |
| OpenAI | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | ~$0.06 |
| fal.ai | [fal.ai/dashboard/keys](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys) | ~$0.035 |

kie.ai is the cheapest way to try this and gives new accounts free credits. Two things to know about it: it can't use brand assets you upload (it only accepts reference images that are already public on the web, which your own thumbnails are), and it doesn't publish a price for its Nano Banana Pro model, so the app shows "cost unknown" for that one instead of guessing.

Those prices are the providers' published rates and are shown as an **estimate** on the Generate button. After each run the app records what the provider actually reported, and the History panel shows both — trust the recorded number.

You can add **several** keys (even two of the same provider) and switch which one is active with **Use this**. Only the active one is ever called. The Thumbnails tab always shows which provider and key it will use.

> **Nothing generates by itself.** Images are only ever produced when you click a Generate button. Closing the app or leaving the tab never starts a run.

---

## Part 5 — Add your first YouTube channel

1. **Integrations** page → scroll to the **YouTube Data API v3** card → in the **Add channel** input below it, paste:
   - the channel URL (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/@MrBeast`), OR
   - the channel handle (e.g. `@MrBeast`), OR
   - the channel ID (e.g. `UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA`)
2. Click **Sync**. The app pulls metadata: title, handle, subscriber count, recent video list.
3. If you set up Google OAuth (step 4.4), click the **Google** button on the channel's row to grant the app access to that channel's Analytics.

---

## Part 6 — Daily usage

- **Dashboard** — overview: top videos by views/engagement, recent activity, alerts.
- **Videos** — every video, sortable. Click one for transcript + AI analysis + comments.
- **AI Chat** — talk to Claude about your channel; attach videos to focus the conversation.
- **Hook Lab** — auto-scores the opening of every video on 7 dimensions (curiosity, value promise, conflict, specific language, identification, pacing, benefit).
- **Competitors** — track other channels, sync their videos.
- **Ideation → Thumbnails** — generate video covers in the style that measurably works on your channel. Click **Analyse what works here** once (it reads your best-performing thumbnails and your competitors'), then generate covers for a title, remix a video you already published, or let the app pick from your Board. It always shows which videos the result was based on. Pick **16:9 video** or **9:16 Shorts** before generating — a Shorts cover is composed for a tall frame, not cropped from a wide one. Each finished cover can be downloaded flat, or as two layers (**Background** and **Text layer**, the headline alone on transparency) if you finish covers in Photoshop or Canva. Needs an image-generation key — see 4.7.
- **Logs** — every API call, error, and event in chronological order. Handy for debugging.

---

## Part 7 — Updating the app

How you update depends on which option you used in Part 2.

### If you used Option B (GitHub Desktop) — the easy way

1. **Stop the app** (close the terminal window the server is running in).
2. Open **GitHub Desktop** → click **Fetch origin**.
3. If GitHub Desktop shows "X commits behind" + a **Pull origin** button → click it. The new code is downloaded into your existing project folder; your `data/` folder is left untouched (it's gitignored).
4. Back in the project folder, double-click `install.bat` / `install.command` once (in case any dependencies changed — takes 30 seconds to a couple of minutes).
5. Launch the app again with `start.bat` / `start.command`.

**Your data survives automatically** because GitHub Desktop never touches the `data/` folder.

### If you used Option A (ZIP download)

1. **Stop the app** (close the terminal window).
2. **Rename your current project folder** to `YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP-old`. Don't delete it yet — we need one folder from it.
3. Re-download the ZIP from **[github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP](https://github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP)** → green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**. Extract it.
4. Open the **OLD** folder, find the `data` subfolder, and **copy it into the NEW folder**. This preserves your API keys, OAuth tokens, channels, transcripts, chat history — everything you've set up.
5. Inside the new folder, run `install.bat` / `install.command` once (dependencies may have changed), then `start.bat` / `start.command`.
6. Once you've verified the new version works and your data is intact, delete the `-old` folder.

> Tip: if you find yourself updating more than once or twice, switching to Option B (GitHub Desktop, Part 2) is worth the 5 minutes it takes to set up.

## Where is everything?

| Thing | Where |
|---|---|
| Your data (DB, API keys, transcripts) | `~/.youtube-channel-ai-vip/app.db` in your home folder — **not** in the project folder |
| The app itself | The project folder you extracted/cloned |
| The "server" (when running) | Running in the terminal window opened by `start.bat`/`start.command` |
| The "website" you interact with | `http://localhost:3010` in your browser |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I close the app and lose my API keys when I reopen it."

**This should NOT happen** with this version — the database uses `synchronous=FULL` and `WAL` mode, plus a graceful-shutdown handler that flushes everything to disk before the process exits. If it does happen:

1. Check that `~/.youtube-channel-ai-vip/` exists in your home folder and contains an `app.db` file. (macOS: `/Users/<you>/.youtube-channel-ai-vip` — it starts with a dot, so Finder hides it; press **Cmd + Shift + .** to show hidden folders. Windows: `C:\Users\<you>\.youtube-channel-ai-vip`.)
2. If `app.db` is there but the app shows no keys → check whether a `DATA_DIR` variable is set in a `.env` file; that overrides the location and the app will be reading a different database.
3. If `app.db` keeps getting recreated empty → there might be an antivirus or sync service (OneDrive, iCloud) eating the WAL files. Move the project out of OneDrive/iCloud-synced folders.
4. If you installed before August 2026 and just updated, look for an old `data/` folder inside the project — the app moves it across on first launch and leaves a `READ-ME-FIRST.txt` behind saying where it went.

### "Port 3010 is already in use."

Another app on your computer is using port 3010. (The app deliberately avoids 3000, which our faceless-video generator uses, so the two run side by side out of the box.) You have two options:

- **Quit the other app** before starting this one, OR
- **Run this app on its own port**, so both can run at the same time. Create a plain text file called `port.txt` in the project folder (next to `start.bat` / `start.command`) containing just a number, for example `3001`. Save it and double-click the launcher again — it will start on that port and open the browser there by itself.

If you use Google login (Part 4) and changed the port, add the new address to Google as well: in the Google Cloud credentials page, add a second redirect URI with your port, e.g. `http://localhost:3001/api/youtube/oauth/callback`. The Integrations page inside the app shows the exact line to paste.

### "Could not download the transcript engine" (when transcribing)

Transcripts need a small helper program (yt-dlp) that the app downloads by itself the first time you ask for a transcript — about 20–40 MB from github.com. If that download fails, everything else in the app keeps working; only transcripts are unavailable. Usually it just means the internet was flaky at that moment — try the transcript again. If your network blocks github.com entirely, the error message tells you where to put a manually downloaded copy.

### "Publish app" is greyed out — "homepage url and privacy policy url are required"

Google now insists on two links before it lets an app leave Testing. Go to **Google Auth Platform → Branding**, paste `https://github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP` as the home page and `https://github.com/YT-Wizards/YouTube-Channel-AI-VIP/blob/main/PRIVACY.md` as the privacy policy, add `github.com` under **Authorized domains**, click **Save**, then go back to **Audience → Publish app**. This is a form to fill, not a review — Google does not check anything.

### "Access blocked: app has not completed verification" (Google OAuth)

Your OAuth app is still in **Testing**, so only listed test users can sign in. The real fix is to publish it: Google Cloud Console → **Google Auth Platform → Audience → Publish app** (status becomes **In production**). That also removes the 7-day re-login. Publishing does not require verification.

Alternative, if you deliberately want to stay in Testing: **Audience → Test users → Add users** → add the Google account you're signing in with. Remember it will then need a re-login every 7 days.

### App won't start, terminal says "EADDRINUSE"

Same as "port in use" — fix above.

### The terminal window flashed and closed on Windows

Means there was an error and the script exited too fast to read it. Open the project folder in File Explorer, hold **Shift**, **right-click in empty space**, pick **Open PowerShell window here** (or **Open in Terminal**), then type `.\install.bat` or `.\start.bat` and press Enter. Now the window stays open and you can see the error.

### macOS says "install.command can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software"

System Preferences → Privacy & Security → scroll down → click **Open Anyway** next to the install.command warning. Then double-click the script again.

## Backup your data

The single most important file is `~/.youtube-channel-ai-vip/app.db`. If you lose it, you lose your API keys, OAuth tokens, transcripts, and chat history.

Updating the app can no longer touch it — it lives outside the project folder, so replacing the project folder leaves it alone. A backup still protects you from the things an update never could: a dead disk, a mistaken delete, a machine change.

**Manual backup**: every week or so, copy `~/.youtube-channel-ai-vip/app.db` to a safe place (Dropbox, USB stick, wherever). To restore: replace the current `app.db` with the backup file while the app is **stopped**.

Don't try to back it up while the app is running — SQLite uses `.db-wal` and `.db-shm` helper files that are part of an in-progress transaction. Stop the app, then copy. Two seconds of downtime, full integrity.

## What if I need to fully reset?

1. Stop the app.
2. Delete the `~/.youtube-channel-ai-vip/` folder in your home folder. (It starts with a dot, so Finder hides it — press **Cmd + Shift + .** to show it.)
3. Launch the app again — it creates a fresh empty database.

You'll need to re-enter all API keys and reconnect channels. The app code, dependencies, and project files are untouched.

> Deleting the project folder does **not** reset anything any more — your data is somewhere else now, and the app will find it again as soon as you launch a new copy.

## Asking for help

If you get stuck:

1. Take a screenshot of whatever you're looking at.
2. If there's a terminal window with red text, screenshot that too.
3. Send both to the developer along with: **which step you're on**, **what you tried**, **what error message you see**.

That's everything they need to help in one round.
